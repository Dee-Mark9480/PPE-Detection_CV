# PPE-Detection_CV
🦺 PPE Detection using YOLO This repository demonstrates Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) detection using a pre-trained YOLO model. The model can identify safety gear such as helmets, vests, and masks in images and videos.

🚀 Project Overview
Ensuring worker safety is essential in industries like construction, manufacturing, and healthcare. This project uses a YOLO-based object detection model to recognize PPE compliance in real-time.

🚀 Project Overview
✅ PPE Detection: Identifies if a person is wearing safety gear (e.g., hardhat, vest, mask).
✅ Compliance Check: Compares detected PPE against required gear for jobs like construction, carpentry, etc.
✅ Works on Images, Videos, and Live Webcam Feeds
✅ Real-time Alerts for Missing PPE
